# Influenza Mortality Analysis
Here the analysis included a variety of data sets, including CDC influenza death
data and US census data. The requirement instructed to conduct an analysis of both
sets of data by integrating them together in order to determine the most effective
way to disperse agency personnel across the US in order to reduce influenza
mortality in the future year.
Excel was used to start my analysis in accordance with the project brief. I
performed all the fundamental analyses, profiled the data integrity, verified its
accuracy, combined the data using lookups, and performed statistical analyses and
hypothesis testing. Finally, I used Tableau to create a data presentation in which I
created a visual storyboard combining various data dashboards.
The project brief, raw data, analysis, and other files are included in the
aforementioned attachments.
